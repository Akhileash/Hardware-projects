The Real-Time Sensor Validation with Firebase Using ESP32 project focuses on
integrating the ESP32 microcontroller with sensors or various other parameters
to transmit accurate environmental data to Firebase in real-time with less latency. 
This project aims to ensure the reliability and accuracy of sensor data through
continuous validation and efficient data handling.
