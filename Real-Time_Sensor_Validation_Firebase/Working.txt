The "Real-Time Sensor Validation with Firebase Using ESP32" project involves an
ESP32 microcontroller that collects environmental data and transmits it in 
real-time to Firebase's Real-Time Database. The data is validated through custom 
logic implemented in Firebase Cloud Functions, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. 
The system provides users with real-time updates, historical trends, and automated
alerts for any anomalies or validation issues through an intuitive dashboard.
